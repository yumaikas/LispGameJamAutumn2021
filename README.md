# AutumnLispGameJam

## Up and running

Install [Janet](https://github.com/janet-lang/janet/releases), and then [JPM](https://github.com/janet-lang/jpm)

Then run `jpm deps` to install jaylib, and run `janet AutumnLispGameJam.janet` to run/test the game

## Plan

This is a bit of a "Raft" demake, I think.

THe idea here being to have the raft of rails float around, trying to collect various sea plants to build bits of food, and also trying to fight off waves of enemies as they come up. That's a thought anyway, right now all that exists is a nice, clicky rail system heh.

## TODO:

- Create moving character with "off-grid" sensors
- Figure out art to give impression of water?
- Figure out what enemy waves look like?
- Figure out "omission"

## Insprational words

Healthy, railroad, green, treat, omission

## Ideas
Railroad:

- Train?
- Laying track?
- On rails shooter?

Green:

- Color scheme?
- Environment theme?
- Jealousy?

Treat:

- Dog treat?
- Candy?
- Hot dog?

Healthy:

- Exercise?
- Zombies?
- Diet?
- Self image?
- Boundaries?

Omission:
- A sense of something removed?
- Genre w/o it's core mechanic?
- 

## Coalescing

Lay track in a grid

Have to survive waves of attacks from society by weaving along the track.

Treats are various self care things that act as upgrades

Omission of what?
